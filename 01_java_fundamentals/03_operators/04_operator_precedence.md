When dealing with complex expressions involving multiple arithmetic operations in Java, it's crucial to understand the 
order of operations. The operator precedence in Java follows the same rules as in mathematics:

1. Parentheses are evaluated first.
2. Then comes division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition.

For example:
```java
int precedenceResult = 4 - 2 + (10 + 5) + 5 * 10 / 2; // Result: 42
System.out.println(precedenceResult);
```

In this case, following the correct order of operations yields the expected result of `42`. Incorrect order would produce 
a different outcome.

However, you can override the default order by using parentheses to force the evaluation of a specific part of an expression 
earlier. For instance:

```java
int result = (10 + 5) * 10; // Result: 150
System.out.println(result);
```

Without parentheses, the result would be `60`.

The operator precedence also applies to string concatenation. The concatenation operator `+` has the same precedence as 
addition, leading to interesting scenarios. For example:

```java
String result = " " + (10 + 5) * 10;
System.out.println(result);
```

This will first evaluate the addition and multiplication, then concatenate the string. Another example:

```java
String result = (10 + 5) + " " + 20 + 5;
System.out.println(result);
```

Here, it evaluates parentheses, concatenates the result with the string, and continues concatenating with `20` and `5`, resulting 
in `205`.

To achieve a different outcome, use parentheses:

```java
String result = (10 + 5) + " " + (20 + 5);
System.out.println(result);
```

I've covered arithmetic operator precedence, but Java has many more operators with varying precedence. If you ever need to 
consult the precedence of each operator, refer to this table.
