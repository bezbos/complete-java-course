You can declare an array of arrays, known as multidimensional arrays. This means having an array whose elements are 
arrays. Though it might seem complex, it's just a matter of perspective.

Multidimensional arrays are typically used for matrix multiplication or creating data structures. While you may not use 
them often, they are still a foundational part of Java.

### Two-Dimensional Array Example

```java
int[][] numberTable = new int[2][2];
// 2D array with 2 elements in the 1st dimension and 2 elements in the 2nd dimension
```

To add elements, specify two indexes:

```java
numberTable[0][0] = 8;
numberTable[0][1] = 16;
numberTable[1][0] = 32;
numberTable[1][1] = 64;
```

Visualization: Rows (1st dimension) and Columns (2nd dimension).

To read an element:

```java
System.out.println("Row 0, Column 0: " + numberTable[0][0]);
// Repeat for other elements
```

Initialize using short-hand syntax:

```java
numberTable = {
    { 8, 16 },
    { 32, 64 }
};
```

### Three-Dimensional Array Example

```java
int[][][] array3d = new int[2][2][2];
// 3D array with 2 elements in each dimension
```

Adding elements follows the same pattern. Visualization: Pages (1st dimension), Rows (2nd dimension), and Columns (3rd dimension).

Print elements:

```java
System.out.println("Page 0, Row 0, Column 0: " + array3d[0][0][0]);
// Repeat for other elements
```

### Four-Dimensional Array Example

```java
int[][][][] array4d = new int[2][2][2][2];
// 4D array with 2 elements in each dimension
```

Adding and printing elements similarly.

Visualization: Books (1st dimension), Pages (2nd dimension), Rows (3rd dimension), and Columns (4th dimension).

### N-Dimensional Arrays
The best way to visualize multidimensional arrays is look at them as coordinate systems, where every element of the array
has a coordinate. This way even if you have to access elements in a 10-dimensional array, you're simply specifying
coordinates for some element.
