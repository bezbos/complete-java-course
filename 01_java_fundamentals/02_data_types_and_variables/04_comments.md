Code can easily become complicated, making it challenging to understand specific portions. Comments provide hints and explanations without affecting the programâ€™s logic.

### Single-line Comments
```java
// this is a single line comment
```

Single-line comments are ideal for small notes and hints, but you can stack them for paragraphs.

### Multi-line Comments
```java
/*
This is
a multiline
comment...
*/
```

Use multi-line comments for more extensive explanations.

### JavaDoc Comments
JavaDoc is used to document methods and types. Hover over a method or type in IntelliJ for quick documentation. Press Ctrl+Q for quick docs.

```java
/**
* The entry point of our application
* @param args program arguments
*/
```

Now, when you check quick documentation for the `main()` method, your comment will appear as documentation.
