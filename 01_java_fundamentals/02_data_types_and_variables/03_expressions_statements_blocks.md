In programming, certain terms are commonly used, and they apply not only to Java but also to other programming languages.

### Expressions

An _expression_ refers to a variable, value, or a combination of variables and values with operators. Examples include:

- `int a`: Variable declaration expression
- `a = 2`: Variable assignment expression
- `a + 3`: Arithmetic expression
- `2`: Literal expression

Expressions can be chained to create a statement.

### Statements

A **statement** is a set of one or more expressions, forming a cohesive unit. For instance:

```java
int a = 1;
```
