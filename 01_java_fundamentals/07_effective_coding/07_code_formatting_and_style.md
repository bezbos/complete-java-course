# Code Formatting & Style

Maintaining consistent formatting in our projects improves readability and maintainability of our code. Most IDEs have
built-in formatters and customizable style rules.

The default rules in IntelliJ and Eclipse are excellent; you usually don't need to change them. It's crucial to regularly 
invoke the formatter to uphold code formatting.

In IntelliJ, press `Ctrl + Alt + L` to format the entire document. For a selected region, use `Ctrl + Alt + L` as well.

Optimize imports by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + O` in IntelliJ. This removes unused imports and adjusts package paths based 
on your IntelliJ configuration.

Explore formatting options in IntelliJ under the "Settings" menu and the "Editor" tab.

Some projects may adopt comprehensive code style guides for strict formatting enforcement. Check out:

- [Spring Framework Style Guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Code-Style)
- [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

These guides offer advanced techniques, but for most projects, the default IDE rules are sufficient.
