# Version Control & Collaboration

Writing clean and well-documented code is essential. If you're utilizing a version control system like Git or any tool 
aiding code backup, change tracking, and collaboration, it's crucial to craft meaningful commit messages.

In Git, each commit serves as a unit of change. While you can visually inspect the commit states, providing clear and 
concise messages remains vital.

Similar to code comments, aim for immediate understanding. Keep your units of change small, enabling easy project reversion
with minimal impact.

### Examples of Poor Git Commit Messages:
```
| Commit message           | Commit hash |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Fixed stuff              | a940581     |
| Work in progress         | 62cbfc2     |
| Changes                  | 62a8cc9     |
| Big changes…             | 4526432     |
| Bug fix                  | 9530c6f     |
| More updates             | c2300cb     |
| Fix for previous fix     | 02260d7     |
| WORKING                  | 7f6fef9     |
| WORKING 2                | 5f66d32     |

```
These vague messages fail to convey the nature of changes. You can't discern the specifics—only that fixes, changes, or 
updates occurred.

### Improved Git Commit Messages:

```
| Commit message                                            | Commit hash |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| fix: Resolve null pointer exception in UserService        | 0b61e85     |
| feat: Add user registration endpoint                      | 741bc5e     |
| docs: Update README with setup instructions               | b86fd0c     |
| style: Format code, optimize imports                      | 10b9147     |
| test: Add unit tests for login functionality              | f99826c     |
| refactor: Simplify database connection handling           | 36474a4     |
| perf: Optimize database query to avoid full table scan    | c1532b3     |
| build: Update Gradle configuration for CI/CD              | cc3fe59     |
| ci: Configure Jenkins for more build options              | 19fa6bb     |
| revert: Revert 'feat: Add user authentication feature'    | 3054bb6     |

```

These messages follow a structured format: prefix indicating the change type, followed by a brief explanation. Ensure 
concise messages by maintaining small units of change.

Feel free to use a similar format or adapt to your preference, but the clarity of your commit messages is paramount.
