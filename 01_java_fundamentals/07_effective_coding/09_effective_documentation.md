## Effective Documentation

In addition to code comments, maintaining technical documentation is crucial for preserving knowledge within a project. This serves as a manual for developers, including ourselves, teammates, and future contributors.

Here are some things that a techincal documentation should contain:

1. **Project Requirements:**
    - Dependencies, runtimes, external components.
    - File permissions, required network ports, and project setup details.

2. **Configuration Options:**
    - Project environment variables.
    - Command-line arguments and flags.
    - Configuration file locations and formats.

3. **Quickstart Instructions:**
    - Steps for building and running the project locally.

4. **API Usage Examples:**
    - Explanation of exposed API endpoints.
    - Examples of requests and responses.

5. **Security:**
    - Authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - User roles and permissions.

6. **Code Formatting and Styling:**
    - Specific rules for the project.

7. **Diagrams:**
    - Visual explanations of mechanisms and features.

8. **Integrations:**
    - Details about third-party system integrations.

9. **License Information.**

10. **Troubleshooting:**
    - Common problems and their solutions.

11. **References:**
    - External resources, documents, and articles.

### Organizing Documentation:

- **README File:**
    - Should include at least instructions for building and running the project.
    - Consider including additional vital information.

- **Separate "docs" Directory:**
    - If the README becomes too extensive, create a "docs" directory in the project root.
    - Store technical documents and assets in this directory.

Remember, concise and clear explanations are key in both code comments and documentation.
