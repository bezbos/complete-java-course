If you haven’t already, you will likely hear about refactoring. IntelliJ provides a “Refactor” option in its code editor’s context menu, offering various ways to change your code.

### What is Refactoring?

Refactoring, according to Martin Fowler's book “Refactoring,” is:

> “the process of changing a software system in a way that does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence, when you refactor, you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.”

**TL;DR:** Refactoring is the practice of restructuring and organizing code to improve maintainability without changing its external behavior.

Developers often deviate from this definition, incorporating additional changes beyond pure refactoring. Some may add or remove features, which, according to Martin’s definition, is considered cleaning up rather than refactoring.

### Understanding Refactoring

Consider refactoring as outlined in IntelliJ's menu. Refactoring includes, but is not limited to:

- Renaming variables, methods, classes, and other code symbols
- Moving classes into different packages
- Reordering variables and methods
- Introducing variables and method parameters
- Inlining variables
- Meaningfully extracting logic into methods and classes
- Replacing code duplicates
- Removing unused variables, methods, classes, and other code symbols

While this may deviate from Martin’s strict definition, it aligns with what most developers understand as “refactoring” in their day-to-day work.
