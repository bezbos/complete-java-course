Loops are fundamental in programming, enabling the repetition of actions until a specified condition fails. Each loop 
comprises a test condition and a code block executed when the condition is true. Each cycle in a loop is called an 
iteration.

The most basic loop is the `while` loop. This loop consists of a test condition and statements executed in each iteration.

Consider a scenario where you have a queue of messages to process. Instead of manually writing code for each message, 
risking errors, you can use a `while` loop to process all messages efficiently.

#### Example:

```java
int numOfMessages = 5; // Pretending we have 5 messages
while (numOfMessages > 0) {
    // Logic to execute for each message
    System.out.println("Processing message " + numOfMessages);

    // Decrement the remaining number of messages
    // to avoid an infinite loop
    numOfMessages--;
}

// Print a message once done
System.out.println("No more messages. Terminating program...");
```

#### Explanation:

Initialization: Set `numOfMessages` to the number of messages.
Condition: The loop iterates as long as `numOfMessages > 0`.
Body: Code inside the loop executes for each message.
Decrement: Reduce the message counter in each iteration.

After the loop, a message is printed to indicate the end of the program.

Understanding loops might be challenging initially, but with persistence, you'll become comfortable using them.
