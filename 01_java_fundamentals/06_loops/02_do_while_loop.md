The `do..while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, with a crucial difference. In the `do..while` loop, 
the iteration is executed first, followed by the condition check for the next iteration. This differs from the normal 
`while` loop, where the condition is checked before executing the iteration.

Consider the example of processing fictional messages using the `do..while` loop:

```java
int numOfMessages = 5;
do {
    // Execute the iteration first
    System.out.println("Processing message " + numOfMessages);
    numOfMessages--;

    // Test the condition afterward
} while (numOfMessages > 0);

// Print a message once done
System.out.println("No more messages. Terminating program...");
```

When you run the program, it will execute the iteration before evaluating the test condition. Compared to the `while` loop,
the `do..while` loop prioritizes executing the iteration before evaluating the condition.

For example, if you set `numOfMessages` to zero, it will execute one iteration of the loop before evaluating the test 
condition, which will be false, leading to an exit from the loop:

```java
// Set numOfMessages to zero
int numOfMessages = 0;
// ...

// Run the program, and the first iteration still gets executed.
```
To recap, the `do..while` loop executes the statements inside the block first and then evaluates the test condition. If 
the condition passes, it executes the next iteration. In contrast, the `while` loop first evaluates the test condition and 
then, if it passes, executes the statements inside the block.

In practice, the `do..while` loop is less commonly used, with developers often preferring the `while` loop or, more commonly, 
the `for` loop, which will be explained next.
