## Windows and Mac
You can download the Java Development Kit (JDK) at:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

I recommend downloading the latest suggested version.

## Linux

### Ubuntu
To install the JDK on Ubuntu, you can use `apt`. Here is a good guide by Linode:
<br/> https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-openjdk-ubuntu-22-04/#how-to-install-openjdk

If you want to use multiple versions of Java, follow this guide:

### Fedora
On Fedora you can use `dnf` to install OpenJDK:
<br/> https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-java

### OpenSUSE
On OpenSUSE the installation is more complicated due to Oracle's licensing issues. 
However, it's not impossible and OpenSUSE provides a guide on how to install Java:

### Arch Linux
Arch Linux has a utility for easily installing Java:
